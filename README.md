## Overview
You are studying late one night at the Cathedral of Learning. When you get up to leave, you notice all the doors are locked. It appears you are being haunted by the spirit of *MJPM*, but who is that? You must search through the Cathedral's nationality rooms and complete puzzles to obtain the key to unlock the Early American room. This will conclude the end of Chapter 1: *The Quilt*.
