## Overview
You are studying late one night at the Cathedral of Learning. When you get up to leave, you notice all the doors are locked. It appears you are being haunted by the spirit of *MJPM*, but who is that? You must search through the Cathedral's nationality rooms and complete puzzles to obtain the key to unlock the Early American room. This will conclude the end of Chapter 1: *The Quilt*.

## Process
We developed this program using Unity for the coding and game mechanics, and Aseprite for creating the artwork. Natalie focused on coding the puzzles, Pearl implemented the character physics and assisted with puzzles, Jessica handled scene transitions and assembled the map, and Maria created all of the artwork, including maps, items, and characters. This was the first time any of us had ever used Unity, so it took a lot of research to understand the program and to learn how to code in C#. Our inspiration for the game comes from this website ([HauntedUSCathedralOfLearning](https://hauntedus.com/pennsylvania/cathedral-learning-pitts-university/)). As the legend has it, Martha Jane Poe McDaniel donated her quilts to the Early American room, and now here spirit remains attatched to them.
